- `src/tests/test_pregnancy.py` - Tests for the pregnancy module.
- `src/hivpy/data/pregnancy.yaml` - Pregnancy data and variables.
- `src/hivpy/pregnancy_data.py` - A class for storing data loaded from `pregnancy.yaml`.

If there are any pregnancy-related variables you would like to change before running your simulation, please change them in `pregnancy.yaml`.
