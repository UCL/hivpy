## HIV Diagnosis Tutorial

The HIV diagnosis module tracks the current HIV test type, test sensitivities, as well as loss of care at diagnosis. The most relevant files are listed below:

- `src/hivpy/hiv_diagnosis.py` - The HIV diagnosis module.
- `src/tests/test_hiv_diagnosis.py` - Tests for the HIV diagnosis module.
- `src/hivpy/data/hiv_diagnosis.yaml` - HIV diagnosis data and variables.
- `src/hivpy/hiv_diagnosis_data.py` - A class for storing data loaded from `hiv_diagnosis.yaml`.

If there are any testing-related variables you would like to change before running your simulation, please change them in `hiv_diagnosis.yaml`.
