## PrEP Tutorial

The PrEP module tracks PrEP eligibility, willingness, and use, including starting, stopping, and restarting PrEP. The most relevant files are listed below:

- `src/hivpy/prep.py` - The PrEP module.
- `src/tests/test_prep.py` - Tests for the PrEP module.
- `src/hivpy/data/prep.yaml` - PrEP data and variables.
- `src/hivpy/prep_data.py` - A class for storing data loaded from `prep.yaml`.

If there are any testing-related variables you would like to change before running your simulation, please change them in `prep.yaml`.
